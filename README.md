> **Browser-based remote terminal and file editor — no port forwarding, no VPS, no network admin required.**

CodeWebway is a single Rust binary that gives you a full terminal and file editor in the browser, on any device. It is built for developers working on machines behind firewalls, NAT, or institutional networks where traditional SSH access is not practical.

## How It Works

```text
Browser  ──HTTPS──▶  zrok edge  ──tunnel──▶  CodeWebway  ──PTY──▶  Shell
```

- One process serves both the backend and the web UI — no separate frontend server.
- Terminal sessions are real server-side PTYs with scrollback replay on reconnect.
- Works on any modern browser — desktop, tablet, or mobile (iOS and Android tested).
- The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Public access is opt-in via `--zrok` or a reverse proxy.

## Quick Start

**Install (macOS / Linux)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iylmwysst/CodeWebway/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Run**

```bash
codewebway -z
```

The startup output prints the token, bind address, and public URL. Open the URL, log in with token + PIN, and you have a terminal.

## When to Use CodeWebway

CodeWebway is optimized for a specific gap: **single-operator remote access from a machine you do not fully control the network on.**

It is not a VPN replacement. It is not an enterprise access platform. It fills the space where those tools are impractical:

- Your machine is behind a university, corporate, or ISP NAT with no port forwarding.
- You cannot get the network team to open a firewall rule.
- You tried VPN but it disconnects on every Wi-Fi handoff or wakes from sleep.
- You want a browser tab, not a separate SSH client install.

**Common use cases**

```bash
# Trigger a build on a remote machine from your laptop's browser
codewebway -z --cwd ~/project

# Let an AI coding agent access a remote shell session
codewebway -z --temp-link --temp-link-scope interactive

# Share a read-only terminal view for debugging help
codewebway -z --temp-link --temp-link-scope read-only --temp-link-ttl-minutes 15

# File-access disabled — terminal only
codewebway -z --terminal-only
```

**Not suitable for**

- Multi-user environments or shared team access
- Replacing a zero-trust access platform (Tailscale, Cloudflare Access)
- Exposing production infrastructure or sensitive services
- Any scenario requiring more than one concurrent authenticated operator

## Comparison

The table below compares tools in the context CodeWebway is designed for:

- You do not control the router or firewall (university, corporate, shared office)
- Only outbound HTTPS is reliably permitted
- Installing a VPN client or kernel module is not an option

All comparisons reflect default/typical configuration. Many tools can be configured beyond their defaults (e.g. SSH over a reverse tunnel, ttyd behind a reverse proxy) — footnotes call out the most important cases.

| | CodeWebway + zrok | OpenSSH¹ | SSH + VPS | Tailscale | ttyd² |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Requires inbound port/firewall rule** | No | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Requires router or firewall control** | No | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Passes outbound HTTPS-only networks** | ✅ likely | ❌ | ⚠ depends | ⚠ DERP fallback | ❌ |
| **Connection layer** | Application | Network | Network | Network mesh | Application |
| **Stable across Wi-Fi changes** | ✅ | ❌ reconnects¹ | ❌ reconnects | ⚠ | ✅ |
| **Direct cost** | Free | Free | ~$5/mo VPS | Free (small scale) | Free |
| **Needs VPS** | No | No | Yes | No | No |
| **Built-in multi-factor login** | ✅ token + PIN | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Browser-native (no client install)** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Works on mobile / tablet** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠ |
| **File editor included** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Single binary** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

¹ Vanilla SSH without autossh/mosh. A reverse SSH tunnel eliminates the port forwarding requirement but adds setup complexity and requires a reachable VPS.

² ttyd can run behind a reverse proxy without direct port exposure, but requires separate proxy configuration.

**On outbound HTTPS:** CodeWebway + zrok uses standard outbound HTTPS, which is commonly allowed in institutional networks. No protocol is guaranteed to pass every environment — deep packet inspection can block any traffic — but HTTPS tunnels are the most likely to work where UDP-based protocols (Tailscale WireGuard, WireGuard VPN) and non-standard ports are filtered.

**On connection stability:** The comparison is against vanilla SSH sessions, which must fully re-establish the TCP connection after a network change. CodeWebway operates at the application layer — a brief drop causes a WebSocket reconnect without tearing down the server-side PTY session. Tools like `mosh` address this for SSH specifically, but require separate installation on both ends.

**On cost:** "free" tools can still require infrastructure access. Direct SSH from outside a NAT needs either port forwarding (requires router control) or a VPS as a relay. CodeWebway + zrok needs neither.

```

## Security

CodeWebway is built for personal public exposure. A terminal in a browser carries full shell access, so security was a first-class design constraint.

### Security Best Practices

Before exposing CodeWebway publicly:

- **Always use TLS.** Use `--zrok` or a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (Caddy, Nginx). Never expose plain HTTP to the public internet.
- **Set a PIN.** The auto-generated token is strong, but adding `--pin` gives you a second independent factor.
- **Set a public timeout.** Use `--public-timeout-minutes` to cap how long the share stays active. Avoid `--public-no-expiry` unless you have a specific reason.
- **Restrict the working directory.** Use `--cwd` to point CodeWebway at a specific project folder rather than your home directory.
- **Run as a non-root user.** CodeWebway requires no elevated privileges. Running it as a dedicated low-privilege user limits blast radius if something goes wrong.
- **Use `--terminal-only` when file access is not needed.** Disables the file browser and editor API surface entirely.

### Transport Flow

```text
Browser
  │
  │  HTTPS (TLS by zrok)
  ▼
zrok edge server  (public internet)
  │
  │  outbound tunnel (no inbound port required)
  ▼
CodeWebway  127.0.0.1:8080  (your machine)
  │  ✔ origin check
  │  ✔ session cookie validated
  │  ✔ rate limit enforced
  ▼
PTY / file system
```

**Do not expose CodeWebway over plain HTTP to the public internet.** Use `-z` (zrok) or a TLS-terminating reverse proxy. With `-z`, all traffic travels over zrok's HTTPS tunnel before reaching the host. The default bind of `127.0.0.1` means the server is unreachable from any external network unless you explicitly opt in.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Login requires both factors to be submitted together:

| Factor | Constraint |
|--------|-----------|
| **Token** | Minimum 16 characters. Auto-generated (80-bit entropy) if omitted. |
| **PIN** | Numeric, minimum 6 digits. Never printed to stdout. |

Both are compared using **constant-time equality** (byte-by-byte XOR fold), which eliminates timing side-channels.

### Brute-Force Lockout

Failed attempts are tracked per client IP. After **3 failures within 5 minutes** the endpoint returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header. A successful login clears the counter. Under `--zrok`, the local port is only reachable via the zrok process — external clients cannot spoof the IP that the rate limiter sees.

### Session Management

- Session tokens: 48-character random alphanumeric (~285-bit entropy).
- Cookies: `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` — no JavaScript access, no cross-site submission.
- Idle timeout: 30 minutes. Absolute timeout: 12 hours. Both enforced server-side.
- Extending a session via `POST /auth/extend` requires re-submitting the PIN — a stolen cookie alone cannot silently renew the session.

### Temporary Links

For sharing access without giving out your primary credentials:

- Links are **HMAC-signed** (SHA-256, random signing key per process, per-link nonce + expiry). Forgery is computationally infeasible.
- Scope is enforced **server-side**: `read-only` sessions have terminal input and file writes silently dropped at the server, not just hidden in the UI.
- Configurable TTL (5 / 15 / 60 min), max-use count, and optional binding to a single terminal tab.
- At most 2 active links at a time. Any link can be individually revoked.

### File Access

- All file paths go through a **canonical prefix check** against the configured root directory. Absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected before canonicalization. Post-canonicalization the result must be a descendant of the root — symlink escapes are blocked.
- File preview capped at 256 KB; writes at 512 KB.
- File APIs are absent entirely in `--terminal-only` mode.

### WebSocket

- The upgrade handler validates the `Origin` header against `Host` (and `X-Forwarded-Host`) before accepting any connection, preventing cross-origin WebSocket hijacking.
- Concurrent connections are capped (default 8, configurable).
- Session validity is re-checked every 15 seconds inside the WebSocket loop; expired sessions are disconnected without waiting for client action.

### Emergency Shutdown

`POST /auth/logout` with `{ "revoke_all": true }` (requires a valid session):

1. Invalidates all sessions and temporary links immediately.
2. Locks the login endpoint — no new sessions until the process restarts.
3. Closes all open terminal tabs.
4. Triggers graceful process shutdown.

### Threat Model

CodeWebway is designed for a **single trusted operator** accessing their own machine. It is not a multi-tenant platform. Anyone who successfully authenticates gets a shell with the same OS privileges as the user who started CodeWebway — that is the intended behavior.

Practical attack surface with `codewebway -z --pin <pin>` (auto-generated token):

| Attack vector | Mitigation |
|---------------|-----------|
| Token brute-force | Lockout after 3 attempts; 80-bit token is infeasible to guess |
| Credential sniffing | zrok provides end-to-end TLS; local bind is 127.0.0.1 |
| Cross-site request forgery | `SameSite=Strict` cookie + `Origin` header validation on WebSocket |
| Path traversal | Canonical prefix check on every file request |
| Session hijack | Short-lived tokens; idle + absolute expiry; PIN required to extend |
| Temp link forgery | HMAC-signed with nonce; forgery is computationally infeasible |
| Stale zrok share after crash | PID-file ownership check reclaims orphaned shares on restart |
| PTY escape sequence injection | Any authenticated session can already write to the PTY — escape sequences are an in-scope capability, not a bypass. Unauthenticated users cannot reach the PTY. |
| Privilege escalation via shell | CodeWebway runs as the invoking user. The shell it spawns inherits the same OS privileges — no privilege boundary exists by design. Run as a low-privilege user to limit blast radius. |

### Secret Management

**Avoid passing credentials as raw CLI arguments in shared or multi-user environments.** Arguments passed via `--password` and `--pin` are visible to other users on the same machine via `ps aux` or `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` for the lifetime of the process.

Safer patterns:

```bash
# Read token from environment variable (not visible in ps on most systems)
export CODEWEBWAY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
codewebway --password "$CODEWEBWAY_TOKEN" --pin 123456

# Or: let CodeWebway auto-generate the token (printed once at startup)
# and type the PIN interactively when prompted
codewebway -z
```

On Linux, you can additionally restrict `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` visibility with tools like `hidepid` on the `/proc` mount, or run CodeWebway under a dedicated user account that others cannot inspect.

### Credential Storage in Memory

Token and PIN are stored as plain `String` values in process memory for the lifetime of the process. They are **not hashed or salted** — this is by design, because constant-time equality comparison (which prevents timing attacks) requires both values to be in plaintext at comparison time. Hashing would break this property.

There is currently no explicit memory zeroing (`zeroize`) on process exit. An attacker with local memory access (e.g., `ptrace`, `/proc/<pid>/mem`, or a core dump) could extract the credentials. This is an acceptable risk for the intended single-operator personal-use case where the attacker would already need elevated OS access to perform such a read — at which point the machine itself is compromised regardless.

If your threat model includes local privilege escalation, run CodeWebway under a dedicated non-root user account with minimal OS permissions, and ensure core dumps are disabled for that account.
